# tally-counter
This app is a very simple tally counter, as you've probably figured out (if not from its function then from its name).
It's the first app I've ever created, and I made it to learn some basic things about Android development, including how buttons, inputs, states, layouts, and activities work.
I hope you find it useful and pleasant to use!
